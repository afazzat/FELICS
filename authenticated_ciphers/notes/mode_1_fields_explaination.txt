Below described are the fields are displayed when mode=1 is used while calculating various metrics.

1. code for "mode"=1 for cipher code size:
   (left --> right corresponds to top --> bottom)

    code size for initialize.c
    code size for process_associated_data.c
    code size for process_plaintext.c
    code size for finalization.c
    code size for tag_generation.c
    code size for process_ciphertext.c
    code size for tag_verification.c
    code size of all the files combined

2. code for "mode"=1 for cipher Execution time:
   (left --> right corresponds to top --> bottom)

    Execution time of Initialize() function
    Execution time of ProcessAssociatedData() function
    Execution time of ProcessPlaintext() function
    Execution time of Finalize() function
    Execution time of ProcessTagGeneration() function
    Execution time of ProcessCiphertext() function
    Execution time of ProcessTagVerification() function


3. code for "mode"=1 for cipher RAM size:
   (left --> right corresponds to top --> bottom)

    RAM usage for Initialize() function
    RAM usage for ProcessAssociatedData() function
    RAM usage for ProcessPlaintext() function
    RAM usage for Finalize() function
    RAM usage for ProcessTagGeneration() function
    RAM usage for ProcessCiphertext() function
    RAM usage for ProcessTagVerification() function

Following values are borrowed from current Block_Cipher module of FELICS. They represent the RAM
usage by shared costants that are defined in separate files and used by one or more of core
functions*

    RAM usage by constants in Initialize() function
    RAM usage by constants in ProcessAssociatedData() function
    RAM usage by constants in ProcessPlaintext() function
    RAM usage by constants in Finalize() function
    RAM usage by constants in ProcessTagGeneration() function
    RAM usage by constants in ProcessCiphertext() function
    RAM usage by constants in ProcessTagVerification() function

    RAM usage for Initialize() function
    RAM usage for Initialize() function

*  I am not very sure about how is this part of RAM usage calculated
** I have to split the current $data_ram_tgv in two variables viz. $data_ram_tg and $data_ram_tv
