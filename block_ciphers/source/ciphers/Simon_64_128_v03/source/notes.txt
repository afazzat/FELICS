Balanced implementation of Simon 64/128

- Four rounds are performed per loop iteration using local variables
  rather than pointers. This slightly unrolls the loop and saves a
  temporary variable.
- rotation functions are inlined
- key schedule use a lookup table for constant Z^3
- only the usefull values of Z^3 for the current configuration of the cipher are stored
