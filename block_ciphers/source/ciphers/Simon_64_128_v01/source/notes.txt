Balanced implementation of Simon/64/128

- Single round is performed per loop iteration using local variables
  rather than pointers
- rotation functions are inlined
- key schedule use a lookup table for constant Z^3
- only the usefull values of Z^3 for the current configuration of the cipher are stored
